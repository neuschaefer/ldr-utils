ldr-utils is a simple command line program for handling LDR files.  LDR files 
are a Visual DSP invention for running code on the Blackfin CPU.  Sometimes 
we need to handle these things in the world of Linux as it is the native 
executable format for the boot rom built into the Blackfin CPU.

To put it simply, LDRs are just a container format for DXEs (which are just a
fancy name for programs in the Blackfin binary object code format).  A single
LDR is made up of an arbitrary number of DXEs and a single DXE is made up of
an arbitrary number of blocks (each block contains starting address and some
flags).
